I will give you R100 bucks if you can get this code to run successfully and print the last pair on the array.

## Rules:
- The script that you need to run is `app.py`, other script I shared are variants that I attempted to optimize for my system.
- You may modify the code only to optimize the performance but it should still populate `empty` array with the (i,j) pairs
- You may use any language of your choice but ideally, try to run it as is.
- Feel free to try it on any hardware that you think is capable of running the code.

## Optional scripts:
* I have shared an additional script `array_cuda.cu` that you can try running if you have an nvidia GPU.
* The code essentially should output the same thing.

---

## Winning conditions:
1. You need record a video running the code and it should output the results as stipulated in the rules.

### Good luck ðŸ˜Ž, get hacking.
